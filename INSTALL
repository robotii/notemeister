NOTEMEISTER has the following dependancies:
	o pygtk 2.2.0
	o Python 2.3.3
	o gnome-python 2.0.2

Installation is done using a standard Python setup.py file. Quick
instructions are:

python setup.py build
python setup.py install ( as root )


You may need to restart gconfd-2 after installing for the first time,
as gconf doesn't sense changes to the central database. Run
'gconftool-2 --shutdown' as your normal user, or send it a SIGHUP.

If you are reinstalling or upgrading Notemeister you may need to use
the --force argument to install, otherwise the old files will not be
replaced.
